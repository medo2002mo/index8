        <h2 style="color:darkcyan;"> The disadvantage of artificial intelligence:</h2>
        <ol> 
            <li> 
                <h3 style="color: darkcyan;">High costs</h3>
                <p>The ability to create a machine that can simulate human intelligence is no small feat.<br>
                     It requires plenty of time and resources and can cost a huge deal of money.<br> 
                     artificial intelligence also needs to operate on the latest hardware and software<br>
                     to stay updated and meet the latest requirements, thus making it quite costly.</p>
            </li>
            <li> 
                <h3 style="color: darkcyan;">No creativity</h3>
                <p>A big disadvantage of artificial intelligence is that it cannot learn to think outside the box.<br>
                     artificial intelligence is capable of learning over time with pre-fed data and past experiences,<br>
                      but cannot be creative in its approach. A classic example is the bot Quill who can write Forbes earning reports.<br>
                       These reports only contain data and facts already provided to the bot.<br>
                     Although it is impressive that a bot can write an article on its own, it lacks the human touch present in other Forbes articles.</p>
            </li>
            <li> 
                <h3 style="color: darkcyan;">Increase in unemployment</h3>
                <p>Perhaps one of the biggest disadvantages of artificial intelligence is that it is slowly replacing a number of repetitive<br>
                     tasks with bots. The reduction in the need for human interference has resulted in the death of many job opportunities.<br>
                     A simple example is the chatbot which is a big advantage to organizations, but a nightmare for employees.</p>
            </li>
            <li> 
                <h3 style="color: darkcyan;">Make humans lazy</h3>
                <p>artificial intelligence  applications automate the majority of tedious and repetitive tasks. <br>
                    Since we do not have to memorize things or solve puzzles to get the job done, we tend to use our brains less and less.<br>
                     This addiction to artificial intelligence can cause problems to future generations.</p>
            </li>
            <li> 
                <h3 style="color: darkcyan;">No ethics</h3>
                <p>Ethics and morality are important human features that can be difficult to incorporate into an artificial intelligence.<br>
                     The rapid progress of AI has raised a number of concerns that one day,<br>
                     artificial intelligence will grow uncontrollably, and eventually wipe out humanity. This moment is referred to as the AI singularity.</p>
