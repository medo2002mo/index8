        <h2 style="color: darkcyan;">what is the importance of artificial intelligence:</h2>
        <p>Artificial intelligence allows computer systems to work with the intellectual processes of humans.
            However, these machines can carry out tasks more dexterously and efficiently than people.<br>
             They can also enter hazardous environments, 
            such as areas that require deep sea diving, making certain processes much safer.
            In short: AI is improving the way we work. <br>It’s not about replacing humans, rather, changing our workplaces for the better.
            For these reasons, it’s currently being utilised by a variety of industries, including:</p>
        <ol> 
            <li> 
                <h3 style="color: darkcyan;">healthcare:</h3>
                <p>artificial intelligence can mimic cognitive functions. This makes it a perfect fit within healthcare,
                     where many issues need addressing to make treatments faster, more effective and more affordable.<br>
                    One example of this is using artificial intelligence to build databases of drugs and medical conditions.
                     This can help us find cures or treatment for rare diseases.<br>
                    AI is also being utilised to make healthcare more affordable around the world.
                     The machine can mimic a doctor’s brain, recognising how humans express their ailments.</p>
            </li>
            <li> 
                <h3 style="color: darkcyan;">transport:</h3>
                <p>Artificial intelligence is greatly improving the efficiency of the transport sector.<br>
                     It can help optimise routes, finding the fastest and safest journeys for different vehicles.</p>
            </li>

                <h3 style="color: darkcyan;">golobal navigation</h3>
                <p>Data collected by Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) can support AI applications.<br>
                     Tracing, tracking, positioning and logistics are all areas that can be greatly improved
                      due to precise and consistent data collection.</p>
            </li>
            <li> 
                <h3 style="color: darkcyan;"> communication</h3>
                <p>Satellites can transfer important information to AI machines, providing reliable and important communication.
                     This can be used for traffic needs, for example.<br>
                      Satellites can collect data, on congestion or accidents, and feed back to the machines.<br>
                     Artificial intelligence can then be used to find alternative courses, rerouting or diverting traffic where necessary.</p>
